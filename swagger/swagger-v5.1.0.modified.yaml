                    have a parent layer, the mapping which was passed to the Store
                    object when it was initialized will be used.

    Topology:
        description: |-
            This description is taken verbatim from the CSI Spec:

            A topological domain is a sub-division of a cluster, like "region",
            "zone", "rack", etc.
            A topological segment is a specific instance of a topological domain,
            like "zone3", "rack3", etc.
            For example {"com.company/zone": "Z1", "com.company/rack": "R3"}
            Valid keys have two segments: an OPTIONAL prefix and name, separated
            by a slash (/), for example: "com.company.example/zone".
            The key name segment is REQUIRED. The prefix is OPTIONAL.
            The key name MUST be 63 characters or less, begin and end with an
            alphanumeric character ([a-z0-9A-Z]), and contain only dashes (-),
            underscores (_), dots (.), or alphanumerics in between, for example
            "zone".
            The key prefix MUST be 63 characters or less, begin and end with a
            lower-case alphanumeric character ([a-z0-9]), contain only
            dashes (-), dots (.), or lower-case alphanumerics in between, and
            follow domain name notation format
            (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1035#section-2.3.1).
            The key prefix SHOULD include the plugin's host company name and/or
            the plugin name, to minimize the possibility of collisions with keys
            from other plugins.
            If a key prefix is specified, it MUST be identical across all
            topology keys returned by the SP (across all RPCs).
            Keys MUST be case-insensitive. Meaning the keys "Zone" and "zone"
            MUST not both exist.
            Each value (topological segment) MUST contain 1 or more strings.
            Each string MUST be 63 characters or less and begin and end with an
            alphanumeric character with '-', '_', '.', or alphanumerics in
            between.

            Preferred:
                description: |-
                    Preferred is a list of Topologies that the volume should attempt to be
                    provisioned in.

                    Taken from the CSI spec:

                    Specifies the list of topologies the CO would prefer the volume to
                    be provisioned in.

                    This field is OPTIONAL. If TopologyRequirement is specified either
                    requisite or preferred or both MUST be specified.

                    An SP MUST attempt to make the provisioned volume available using
                    the preferred topologies in order from first to last.

                    If requisite is specified, all topologies in preferred list MUST
                    also be present in the list of requisite topologies.

                    If the SP is unable to make the provisioned volume available
                    from any of the preferred topologies, the SP MAY choose a topology
                    from the list of requisite topologies.
                    If the list of requisite topologies is not specified, then the SP
                    MAY choose from the list of all possible topologies.
                    If the list of requisite topologies is specified and the SP is
                    unable to make the provisioned volume available from any of the
                    requisite topologies it MUST fail the CreateVolume call.

                    Example 1:
                    Given a volume should be accessible from a single zone, and
                    requisite =
                    {"region": "R1", "zone": "Z2"},
                    {"region": "R1", "zone": "Z3"}
                    preferred =
                    {"region": "R1", "zone": "Z3"}
                    then the SP SHOULD first attempt to make the provisioned volume
                    available from "zone" "Z3" in the "region" "R1" and fall back to
                    "zone" "Z2" in the "region" "R1" if that is not possible.

                    Example 2:
                    Given a volume should be accessible from a single zone, and
                    requisite =
                    {"region": "R1", "zone": "Z2"},
                    {"region": "R1", "zone": "Z3"},
                    {"region": "R1", "zone": "Z4"},
                    {"region": "R1", "zone": "Z5"}
                    preferred =
                    {"region": "R1", "zone": "Z4"},
                    {"region": "R1", "zone": "Z2"}
                    then the SP SHOULD first attempt to make the provisioned volume
                    accessible from "zone" "Z4" in the "region" "R1" and fall back to
                    "zone" "Z2" in the "region" "R1" if that is not possible. If that
                    is not possible, the SP may choose between either the "zone"
                    "Z3" or "Z5" in the "region" "R1".

                    Example 3:
                    Given a volume should be accessible from TWO zones (because an
                    opaque parameter in CreateVolumeRequest, for example, specifies
                    the volume is accessible from two zones, aka synchronously
                    replicated), and
                    requisite =
                    {"region": "R1", "zone": "Z2"},
                    {"region": "R1", "zone": "Z3"},
                    {"region": "R1", "zone": "Z4"},
                    {"region": "R1", "zone": "Z5"}
                    preferred =

                    {"region": "R1", "zone": "Z3"}
                    then the SP SHOULD first attempt to make the provisioned volume
                    accessible from the combination of the two "zones" "Z5" and "Z3" in
                    the "region" "R1". If that's not possible, it should fall back to
                    a combination of "Z5" and other possibilities from the list of
                    requisite. If that's not possible, it should fall back  to a
                    combination of "Z3" and other possibilities from the list of
                    requisite. If that's not possible, it should fall back  to a
                    combination of other possibilities from the list of requisite.

                    If requisite is specified, the provisioned volume MUST be
                    accessible from at least one of the requisite topologies.

                    Given

        This documentation describes the Podman v2.x+ RESTful API. It consists of a Docker-compatible
        API and a Libpod API providing support for Podman’s unique features such as pods.

        To start the service and keep it running for 5,000 seconds (-t 0 runs forever):

        podman system service -t 5000 &

        You can then use cURL on the socket using requests documented below.

        NOTE: if you install the package podman-docker, it will create a symbolic
        link for /run/docker.sock to /run/podman/podman.sock

        NOTE: Some fields in the API response JSON are encoded as omitempty, which means that
        if said field has a zero value, they will not be encoded in the API response. This
        is a feature to help reduce the size of the JSON responses returned via the API.

        NOTE: Due to the limitations of [go-swagger](https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger),
        some field values that have a complex type show up as null in the docs as well as in the
        API responses. This is because the zero value for the field type is null. The field
        description in the docs will state what type the field is expected to be for such cases.

        See podman-system-service(1) for more information.

        Quick Examples:

        'podman info'

        curl --unix-socket /run/podman/podman.sock http://d/v5.0.0/libpod/info

        'podman pull quay.io/containers/podman'

        curl -XPOST --unix-socket /run/podman/podman.sock -v 'http://d/v5.0.0/images/create?fromImage=quay.io%2Fcontainers%2Fpodman'

        'podman list images'

        curl --unix-socket /run/podman/podman.sock -v 'http://d/v5.0.0/libpod/images/json' | jq

                Attach to a container to read its output or send it input. You can attach

                ### Hijacking

                This endpoint hijacks the HTTP connection to transport `stdin`, `stdout`,
                and `stderr` on the same socket.

                This is the response from the service for an attach request:

                ```
                HTTP/1.1 200 OK
                Content-Type: application/vnd.docker.raw-stream

                [STREAM]
                ```

                After the headers and two new lines, the TCP connection can now be used
                for raw, bidirectional communication between the client and server.

                To inform potential proxies about connection hijacking, the client
                can also optionally send connection upgrade headers.

                For example, the client sends this request to upgrade the connection:

                ```
                POST /v4.6.0/libpod/containers/16253994b7c4/attach?stream=1&stdout=1 HTTP/1.1
                Upgrade: tcp
                Connection: Upgrade
                ```

                The service will respond with a `101 UPGRADED` response, and will
                similarly follow with the raw stream:

                ```
                HTTP/1.1 101 UPGRADED
                Content-Type: application/vnd.docker.raw-stream
                Connection: Upgrade
                Upgrade: tcp

                [STREAM]
                ```

                ### Stream format

                When the TTY setting is disabled for the container,
                the HTTP Content-Type header is set to application/vnd.docker.multiplexed-stream
                (starting with v4.7.0, previously application/vnd.docker.raw-stream was always used)
                and the stream over the hijacked connected is multiplexed to separate out
                `stdout` and `stderr`. The stream consists of a series of frames, each
                containing a header and a payload.

                The header contains the information about the output stream type and the size of
                the payload.
                It is encoded on the first eight bytes like this:

                ```go
                header := [8]byte{STREAM_TYPE, 0, 0, 0, SIZE1, SIZE2, SIZE3, SIZE4}
                ```

                `STREAM_TYPE` can be:

                - 0: `stdin` (is written on `stdout`)
                - 1: `stdout`
                - 2: `stderr`

                `SIZE1, SIZE2, SIZE3, SIZE4` are the four bytes of the `uint32` size
                encoded as big endian.

                Following the header is the payload, which contains the specified number of
                bytes as written in the size.

                The simplest way to implement this protocol is the following:

                1. Read 8 bytes.
                2. Choose `stdout` or `stderr` depending on the first byte.
                3. Extract the frame size from the last four bytes.
                4. Read the extracted size and output it on the correct output.
                5. Goto 1.

                ### Stream format when using a TTY

                When the TTY setting is enabled for the container,
                the stream is not multiplexed. The data exchanged over the hijacked
                connection is simply the raw data from the process PTY and client's
                `stdin`.
